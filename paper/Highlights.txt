Highlights:

We analyzed spontaneous turn-transition prediction by children ages 1â€“6.One-year-olds could already predict upcoming turns at rates greater than chance.Children under three showed a general advantage for prosody over lexicosyntax.Children two and up showed an advantage for lexicosyntax, but only within questions.We find no evidence that lexicosyntax is sufficient for prediction in young children.
